**Under active development; not ready for use**

Purpose
=======

This repository contains scripts for reading, transforming and combining
datasets that are relevant for analysis of behavioral health and social
determinants of health (SDoH) at the local neighborhood level (using
‘census tract’ as a proxy for ‘neighborhood’) and, where necessary,
county level.

Datasets
========

This list includes datasets which are available at one or more of the
following levels of aggregation:

-   Address (*allows for geocoding and attribution of location to census
    tract*)
-   Census Tract
-   County

These lower levels of aggregation can be rolled up to state level using
FIPS codes.

The list of datasets are tracked in the `.csv` file located in the data
folder, with more specific documentation found below as issues are
identified. Please push a commit marking the `complete` field in the
.csv file as `TRUE`. There are currently 13 datasets completed for
inclusion.

Processing and Format
=====================

There are different output file formats for each level of aggregation in
the data.

Census Tract Dataset
--------------------

The following fields must be included in all files:

-   `dataset`: A shortened name of the dataset, to allow for subsetting
    when datasets are combined.
-   `state`: Two-digit state 2010 FIPS code
-   `county`: Three-digit county 2010 FIPS code
-   `tract`: Six-digit tract 2010 FIPS code
-   `year`: The year of the published dataset.
-   `race`: Should be marked as `pooled` where data is not broken out by
    race. Should be marked as `NA` when the variable is not related to a
    population metric, such as in a count of facilities.
-   `gender`: Should be marked as `pooled` where data is not broken out
    by gender. Should be marked as `NA` when the variable is not related
    to a population metric, such as in a count of facilities.
-   `age_range`: Should be marked as `pooled` where data is not broken
    out by age range. Should be marked as `NA` when the variable is not
    related to a population metric, such as in a count of facilities.
-   `var_name`: The name of the variable/metric being reported.
-   `value`: The numeric value of the measure identified in `var_name`
-   `stat_type`: The type of summary statistic being reported in
    `value`. For example: `n`, `mean`, `se`, `median`, etc.

County-level Dataset
--------------------

All fields from the census tract level data should be included in all
files, other than the `tract` variable.

Address Dataset
---------------

Address-level datasets should include the following fields:

-   `dataset`: A shortened name of the dataset, to allow for subsetting
    when datasets are combined.
-   `state`:
-   `county`:
-   `tract`: The census tract within which the address is located,
    obtained by using the `TBDfun::census_tract` function.
-   `address`:
-   `lat`, `lon`: Geocoded latitude and longitude coordinates of
    `address`
-   `year`: The year of the published dataset.
-   `...`: Other variables specific to the dataset, which may be of
    value to retain, though these will not be aggregated in the tract or
    county-level data.

Variables
=========

A list of available variables in the combined datasets are available in
[the data
dictionary](https://github.com/j-hagedorn/locals/blob/master/docs/data_dictionary.csv).
