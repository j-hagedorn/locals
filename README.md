**Under active development; not ready for use**

Purpose
=======

This repository contains scripts for reading, transforming and combining
datasets that are relevant for analysis of behavioral health and social
determinants of health (SDoH) at the local neighborhood level (using
‘census tract’ as a proxy for ‘neighborhood’) and, where necessary,
county level.

Datasets
========

The list of datasets are tracked in the `.csv` file located in the data
folder, with more specific documentation found below as issues are
identified. Please push a commit marking the `status` field in the
