# Introduction ====
#======================#

# The script is intended to pull variables from the census api and store in our database. 
# Any variable needs to be explicitly named and documented in the data_dictionary CSV
# as well as in the code below. In general, the naming convention takes the following form: 

# variable_by_group_universe

# Where:
# variable is the name of the measure (medicaid)
# by group is any subset of the variable (medicaid_under65)
# universe is the grain at which the variable is taken (medicaid_under65_pop)

# For example, the variable B11012 looks at female householders with no spouse or parent 
# but with their own children 18 and under; basically single mother households. 

# The variable would be single householders,the by-group is mothers and the universe the number of homes.
# Therefore the variable name is named: 

# single_mom_homes

# Use this query to scan different variable: 

census_api_key(Sys.getenv("CENSUS_API_KEY"))
